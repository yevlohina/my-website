          <h2>Why I chose design</h2>
          <p class="description-home">
            I moved into design after years in marketing because I wanted to
            create not just campaigns, but experiences that really help people.
            Design lets me combine strategy, empathy, and aesthetics — and see
            real impact in what I do.

          <h2>What inspires me</h2>
          <p class="description-home">
            I’m inspired by human stories, meaningful visuals, and small details
            that make daily life easier or more beautiful. I love when design
            feels honest, emotional, and thoughtful.

          <h2>My goals</h2>
          <p class="description-home">
            I want to grow as a UX/UI designer and keep learning every day —
            from users, colleagues, and real projects.
          </p>
          <p class="description-home">My main goals are:</p>
          <ul class="description-home">
            <li>
              to build digital products that feel intuitive, emotional, and
              inclusive;
            </li>
            <li>
              to work on meaningful projects that help people adapt, learn, or
              feel connected;
            </li>
            <li>
              to refine my design process — from research to prototypes — and
              become stronger in both UX and visual design;
            </li>
            <li>
              to join a creative team that values empathy, curiosity, and
              collaboration.
            </li>
          </ul>
